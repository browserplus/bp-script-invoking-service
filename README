This repo can be used to build the BrowserPlus script invoking service.
This is a simple service that invokes a shell script or batch file.
The output of the script is captured inside the ruby environment and
can then be manipulated, returned, whatever.

This service uses submodules browserplus/bakery, and browserplus/bp-service-framework.
 
Instructions to build the service are in the file BUILDING.
